The most annoying feature of another system that's out there is that the system would send the user over 50 texts every night whenever the alarms would dip below his set temperature and then back up again.  So I plan to allow people to set a "silent" time, either a duration after the first text or a set time of day during which there should be a limited number of texts, to allow the user to still respond to the need for frost control if he needs to.
