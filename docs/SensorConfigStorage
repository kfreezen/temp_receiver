The purpose of Sensor configuration storage is to allow the system to more fully understand when each sensor has responded.
There will be two ways of storing the configuration.  The server will have a "map" or "list" in its database of the receivers network.
The receiver will also store its list of connected sensors in binary format on its local filesystem.
The local receiver system must hold the sensor ID and the last known transmission of that sensor.

On any reboot, the receiver must have a silent time for about 90 seconds to prevent squawking to the server about lost sensors due to the time it takes on a reboot.
