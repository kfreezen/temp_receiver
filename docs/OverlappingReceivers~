	What happens when a sensor is at a point where it broadcasts its receiver request to two receivers at once?
I don't know what happens, but it can't be very desirable.  Here is the protocol the sensor will use to determine
which to use:

Trying addresses by broadcast:
1.  Sensor checks its EEPROM for a valid address.  If one is found go to section "Trying EEPROM address"
2.  Sensor sends out "receiver request" packet.
3.  Sensor waits for the first response.
3a.  Sensor will time out after ~8 seconds and restart if no response is given.
4.  The sensor stores the address of the first receiver to reply in EEPROM.

Trying EEPROM address:

1.  Sensor checks the "receiver request retries" variable.  If that variable is over 32,
	go to section "Trying address by broadcast", step 2. 
2.  Sensor sends a receiver request to the address and increments a "receiver request retries" variable in EEPROM.
3.  Sensor times out after ~1 second if no reply is heard.
4.  If receiver at this address replies, the sensor clears the "receiver request retries" variable.
